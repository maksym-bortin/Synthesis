This repository contains the material accompanying 'Synthesis of Implementations for Divide-and-conquer Specifications',
and comprises the following theories for the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover 
(version 2022, see www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle and LICENSE for details):

 - Preliminaries.thy  -- the underlying framework
 - DaC_synthesis.thy  -- the divide-and-conquer design tactic with the relator used in the publication
 - Powerset.thy       -- an introductory example application of the tactic to power set construction
 - Greedy.thy         -- the case study concerning bases of finite matroids
 - Scheduling.thy     -- an application of the greedy tactic to a scheduling problem
 - DaC_synthesis2.thy -- the same divide-and-conquer tactic but with another relator          
 - Quicksort.thy -- an application of the tactic to synthesise the quicksort algorithm.
