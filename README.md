This repository contains the material accompanying 'Synthesis of Implementations for Divide-and-conquer Specifications',
and comprises the following theories for the Isabelle/HOL theorem prover 
(version 2022, see www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle for details):

- Preliminaries.thy  --- the underlying framework
- DaC_synthesis.thy  --- the divide-and-conquer design tactic for the relator used in the publication
- Greedy.thy         --- the derived tactic for computation of optimal bases of finite matroids
- Scheduling.thy     --- the job scheduling example

- Dac_synthesis2.thy --- the same divide-and-conquer design tactic but for a different relator instance
- Quicksort.thy      --- another example: quicksort
